Build it yourself
-----------------

You can build the plugin by oneself by cloning this repository locally - make sure you have java and maven 3.X correctly 
installed - and run 

```mvn clean install assembly:single```

in the project folder. The plugin dist.jar will be created in the target folder and can be installed via the 
Plugin Managers' "Load from File" action.
